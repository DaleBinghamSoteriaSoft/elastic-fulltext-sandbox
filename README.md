# elastic-fulltext-sandbox

Thjis is a demo C# console client to connect into Elastic Stack in OpenRMF Professional, load sample checklist/patch/other data and then see how to full text index and query it.

Initial work was talked about with Scott Karter as well as tychon.io and others at NGA for full text searching.
